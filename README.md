## The Odin Project ##
05/01/26 Setting Up Dev Environment with Linux Mint & VSCodium, painfully, Ubuntu issues in VirtualBox slowed this down.
Uninstalled flatpak version of VsCodium, reinstalled with terminal commands
Practicing navigating and editing files with the terminal

06/01/26 More time spent setting things up, reading through basic html setup

07/01/26 Running through HTML basics. Learnt about page anchors and link hijacking security! Everything else was a repeat, but good to go back to basics.

Some Linux terminal commands:
touch abc.txt # makes a file
codium abc.txt # opens a file in VS
mkdir abc # makes a folder
cd .. # goes up a folder
mv abc.txt abc # moves abc.txt into abc
mv abc.txt .. # moves abc.txt back into parent folder
cd ~ # navigates back to base directory
